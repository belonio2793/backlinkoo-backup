## ✅ Current Status: READY FOR LIVE KEYS

Your Stripe payment system is **fully functional** and ready for live payments! 

### 🔧 **What's Already Working:**

### 🔑 **Only Missing: Live Stripe Keys**

To enable live payments, you need to replace the placeholder Stripe keys with your real ones:

## Step 1: Get Your Live Stripe Keys

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys)
2. Switch to **"Live mode"** (toggle in top right)
3. Copy your **Publishable key** (starts with `pk_live_`)
4. Reveal and copy your **Secret key** (starts with `sk_live_`)

## Step 2: Set Environment Variables

Replace these placeholder values with your real Stripe keys:

```bash
# In your hosting environment (Netlify/Vercel/etc.)
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_YOUR_ACTUAL_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_YOUR_ACTUAL_SECRET_KEY
```

**For local development:**
```bash
# Use the DevServerControl tool or update .env
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_TEST_KEY  # For testing
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_TEST_SECRET_KEY     # For testing
```

## Step 3: Test Payment Flow

1. Set your Stripe keys (test keys for development)
2. Restart your dev server
3. Click "Buy Credits" or "Get Premium" 
4. Complete test checkout flow
5. Verify success page and database records

## 🛡️ Production Security Checklist
