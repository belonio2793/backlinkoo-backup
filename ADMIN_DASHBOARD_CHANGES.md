# Admin Dashboard Changes Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed "Overall Service Health" Section
- **Location**: `src/components/admin/ServiceConnectionStatus.tsx`
- **Removed**: The "Overall Service Health" card that displayed "Last checked: time" and "Connected Services X/Y (percentage%)"
- **Reason**: User requested removal of this section to declutter the admin interface

### 2. Rebuilt Environment Tab
- **Created**: New `src/components/admin/NetlifyEnvironmentManager.tsx` component
