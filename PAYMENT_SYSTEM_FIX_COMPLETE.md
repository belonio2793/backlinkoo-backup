# Payment System Fix - Complete

## ðŸš¨ Issue Identified & Fixed

**Problem**: The app was deployed on Fly.dev but trying to call Netlify functions (`/.netlify/functions/create-payment`) which don't exist on Fly.dev, causing 404 errors.

## âœ… Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Payment Service Logic
- Modified `src/services/creditPaymentService.ts` to detect deployment environment
- Removed Netlify function calls when not on Netlify deployment
- Improved Supabase Edge Function handling with better logging

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added early return on successful Supabase Edge Function calls
- Improved debugging output for payment flow
- Better environment detection (Fly.dev vs Netlify vs localhost)

### 3. Added Diagnostic Tools
- Created `PaymentDebugger` component for real-time diagnostics
- Added to `/payment-test` page for easy debugging
- Comprehensive testing of all payment endpoints

## ðŸ”§ Required Configuration

**IMPORTANT**: For the Supabase Edge Function to work, these environment variables must be set in your **Supabase project** (not just locally):

1. **In Supabase Dashboard** â†’ Project Settings â†’ Edge Functions â†’ Environment Variables:
   ```
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=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
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key_here
   SUPABASE_URL=https://dfhanacsmsvvkpunurnp.supabase.co
   ```

## ðŸ§ª Testing Steps

1. **Visit `/payment-test`** in your app
2. **Run Payment Diagnostics** to check configuration
3. **Test credit purchase** with fixed endpoints

## ðŸŽ¯ Payment Flow Now

```
User clicks "Buy Credits" 
â†’ Detects Fly.dev environment
â†’ Calls Supabase Edge Function (create-payment)
â†’ Creates Stripe checkout session
â†’ Opens new window with Stripe checkout
```

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. **Configure Supabase Environment Variables** (most important)
2. **Test payment flow** on your live site
3. **Verify webhook integration** for credit allocation

The payment system should now work correctly on your Fly.dev deployment once the Supabase environment variables are configured.
