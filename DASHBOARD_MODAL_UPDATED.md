# ✅ Dashboard Modal Updated to Match Header

## Changes Made

Successfully updated the Dashboard to use the same `ModernCreditPurchaseModal` as the header for complete consistency.

### **🔄 Changes Applied:**

1. **Added Modal State:**
   ```typescript
   const [showCreditModal, setShowCreditModal] = useState(false);
   ```

2. **Replaced UniversalPaymentComponent:**
   ```typescript
   // ❌ Before - Complex component with different interface
   <UniversalPaymentComponent
     trigger={<Button>Buy Your First Credits</Button>}
     defaultType="credits"
     showTrigger={false}
     onPaymentSuccess={...}
   />

   // ✅ After - Simple button that opens consistent modal
   <Button onClick={() => setShowCreditModal(true)}>
     <Plus className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
     Buy Your First Credits
   </Button>
   ```

3. **Added ModernCreditPurchaseModal:**
   ```typescript
   <ModernCreditPurchaseModal
     isOpen={showCreditModal}
     onClose={() => setShowCreditModal(false)}
     onSuccess={() => {
       setShowCreditModal(false);
       fetchUserData(); // Refresh credits
       fetchCampaigns(); // Refresh campaigns
       toast({
         title: "Payment Successful!",
         description: "Your credits have been added to your account."
       });
     }}
   />
   ```

4. **Cleaned Up Imports:**
   - Removed unused `UniversalPaymentComponent` import
   - Kept `ModernCreditPurchaseModal` import

### **🎯 Result:**

- ✅ **Header Buy Credits:** Uses `ModernCreditPurchaseModal`
- ✅ **Dashboard Buy Credits:** Now uses `ModernCreditPurchaseModal` 
- ✅ **Consistent Experience:** Same modal design everywhere
- ✅ **Same Payment Flow:** Both lead to Stripe checkout
- ✅ **Unified Branding:** Matches the modal in your provided image

### **🧪 Testing:**

1. Navigate to `/dashboard`
2. Click "Buy Your First Credits" (for new users)
3. Modal should open with the same design as header modal:
   - 4 preset packages (50/$70, 100/$140, 250/$350, 500/$700)
   - Custom amount section
   - Features list
   - Same styling and layout

The entire app now uses the consistent `ModernCreditPurchaseModal` design!
