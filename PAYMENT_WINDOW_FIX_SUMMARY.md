# Payment Window Fix Summary

## ✅ **Issues Fixed**

### 1. **Environment Variable Configuration**
- **Problem**: Code was looking for `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` but you had `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- **Solution**: You correctly updated to use `VITE_` prefix for frontend environment variables
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed with your test keys configuration

### 2. **Development Environment Fallback**
- **Problem**: Payment endpoints returning 404 in development environment
- **Solution**: Created development fallback that opens test checkout in new window
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed - now properly handles localhost development

### 3. **New Window Opening**
- **Problem**: Checkout wasn't opening in new window as requested
- **Solution**: Enhanced both payment modals to properly open checkout in new windows
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed - checkout opens in new window with proper dimensions

### 4. **Error Handling & Debugging**
- **Problem**: "[object Object]" error messages weren't helpful
- **Solution**: Improved error serialization and added detailed logging
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed - clear error messages and debugging tools
