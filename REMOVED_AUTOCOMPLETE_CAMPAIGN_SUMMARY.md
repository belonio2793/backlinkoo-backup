## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Removed Auto-Continuation Logic
**File**: `netlify/functions/working-campaign-processor.js`
**Lines**: 100-105 (simplified)

#### Previous Complex Logic (Removed)
```javascript
// OLD - Complex platform rotation and auto-continuation
const shouldComplete = await checkAllPlatformsCompleted(supabase, campaignId);

if (shouldComplete) {
  await updateCampaignStatus(supabase, campaignId, 'completed', publishedUrls);
} else {
  const nextAvailablePlatform = await getNextAvailablePlatform(supabase, campaignId);
  
  if (nextAvailablePlatform) {
    await updateCampaignStatus(supabase, campaignId, 'active', publishedUrls);
    
    // Auto-trigger next platform after delay
    setTimeout(async () => {
      // Complex auto-continuation logic...
    }, 3000);
  }
}
```

#### New Simplified Logic (Current)
```javascript
// NEW - Simple completion after Telegraph
await updateCampaignStatus(supabase, campaignId, 'completed', publishedUrls);
await logCampaignActivity(supabase, campaignId, 'info', 
  `Campaign completed successfully. Published to ${platform}: ${publishedUrls[0]}`);

console.log('✅ Campaign completed after Telegraph publishing');
```

### Removed Functions
- **Removed**: `triggerNextPlatformProcessing()` - No longer needed
- **Kept**: `logCampaignActivity()` - Still useful for logging
- **Kept**: Other platform functions - May be used elsewhere
