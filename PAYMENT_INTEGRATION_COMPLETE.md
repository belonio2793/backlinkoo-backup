# ✅ Payment Integration Complete - All Modals Fixed

## 🎯 **Issue Resolved**

**Problem**: Credit purchase modals were showing "Failed to create payment" errors due to trying to access Netlify functions on a Fly.dev deployment.

**Root Cause**: Multiple payment services were hardcoded to call `/.netlify/functions/create-payment` which doesn't exist on Fly.dev.

## 🔧 **Services Fixed**

### ✅ Primary Services (Now Using Supabase Edge Functions)
1. **CreditPaymentService** ✅ (Already working)
2. **stripePaymentService** ✅ (Fixed to use Supabase Edge Functions)
3. **directCheckoutService** ✅ (Fixed to use Supabase Edge Functions) 
4. **universalStripeCheckout** ✅ (Fixed to use Supabase Edge Functions)

### ✅ Modal Components Integration
1. **ImprovedPaymentModal** ✅ (Uses CreditPaymentService - main modal in app)
2. **BuyCreditsButton** ✅ (Uses CreditPaymentService)
3. **CustomCreditsModal** ✅ (Uses CreditPaymentService)
4. **DirectPaymentButtons** ✅ (Uses fixed DirectCheckoutService)

## 💰 **Payment Flow Now**

```
User clicks "Buy Credits" 
→ Opens ImprovedPaymentModal (main modal)
→ User selects credit package (50, 100, 250, 500 credits)
→ Modal calls CreditPaymentService.createCreditPayment()
→ Service calls Supabase Edge Function (create-payment)
→ Creates Stripe checkout session
→ Opens new window with Stripe checkout ✅
```
