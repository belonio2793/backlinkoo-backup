# ✅ Payment Error Fixed

## Issue Resolved

**Error:** `UniversalPaymentComponent is not defined`

**Root Cause:** In `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`, the import statement was only importing named exports but not the main component:

```typescript
// ❌ Before (incomplete import)
import { QuickCreditButton, PremiumUpgradeButton } from "@/components/UniversalPaymentComponent";

// ✅ After (complete import)  
import { QuickCreditButton, PremiumUpgradeButton, UniversalPaymentComponent } from "@/components/UniversalPaymentComponent";
```

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed Import:** Added `UniversalPaymentComponent` to the import statement in Dashboard.tsx
2. **Added ModernCreditPurchaseModal Import:** For future consistency with header modal
3. **Maintained Compatibility:** All existing functionality preserved

## Modal Consistency

- **Header:** Uses `ModernCreditPurchaseModal` (matches your requested modal design)
- **Dashboard:** Currently uses `UniversalPaymentComponent` (now working correctly)
- **Both modals** lead to the same Stripe checkout flow

## Next Steps

The error should now be resolved. If you want complete consistency and want the Dashboard to use the same modal as the header (the one in your image), let me know and I can update the Dashboard component to use `ModernCreditPurchaseModal` instead.

## Testing

- Navigate to `/dashboard` - error should be gone
- Click "Buy Your First Credits" - should open payment modal
- Click header "Buy Credits" - should open the modal matching your image
