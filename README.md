# Backlink Automation System

A comprehensive link-building automation platform that generates high-quality content with embedded backlinks and publishes them across multiple high-authority platforms.

## üéØ Overview

The Backlink Automation System enables users to create automated campaigns that generate contextually relevant content and publish it across various platforms to build high-quality backlinks for improved SEO performance.

## üöÄ How It Works

### User Campaign Creation

Users create campaigns by providing three key inputs:

1. **Target URL** - The destination website or domain they want to rank
2. **Keyword** - The term used to generate contextually relevant content  
3. **Anchor Text** - The clickable text that links to the target URL, strategically embedded within content
