# Premium Status Fix Implementation

## Issue
User `labindalawamaryrose@gmail.com` should have premium status but the dashboard shows them as non-premium (orange notification dot on "Premium Plan" button).

## Root Cause
The premium status detection relies on the `profiles` table having:
- `role: 'premium'` OR
- `subscription_tier: 'premium'` OR `subscription_tier: 'monthly'` OR
- `role: 'admin'`

If the user's profile doesn't have these values set correctly, they will appear as non-premium.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Premium Status Utility (`src/utils/setPremiumStatus.ts`)
- Created utility function to set/update user profile to premium status
- Handles both creating new profiles and updating existing ones
- Sets: `role: 'premium'`, `subscription_tier: 'premium'`, `subscription_status: 'active'`

### 2. Dashboard Integration (`src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`)
- Added `fixPremiumStatus()` function that calls the utility
- Added "Fix Premium" button that appears only for `labindalawamaryrose@gmail.com` when not premium
- Button triggers the fix and refreshes premium status in real-time
- Provides user feedback via toast notifications

### 3. Premium Status Detection Logic
The system checks premium status using this logic (from `userService.ts`):
```typescript
const isPremium = profile?.subscription_tier === 'premium' ||
                 profile?.subscription_tier === 'monthly' ||
                 profile?.role === 'admin';
```

## How to Use
1. User logs in as `labindalawamaryrose@gmail.com`
2. If not showing as premium, they'll see an orange "Fix Premium" button next to the navigation
3. Click "Fix Premium" button
4. System updates their profile to premium status
5. Dashboard immediately refreshes to show premium features
6. Orange notification dot changes to green, "Premium Plan" becomes "Premium Dashboard"

## Files Modified
- `src/utils/setPremiumStatus.ts` (new)
- `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` (added import, function, and button)
- `PREMIUM_STATUS_FIX.md` (this documentation)

## Next Steps
- User can now click "Fix Premium" to resolve their premium status
- Once fixed, they'll have access to all premium features
- The fix button will disappear once premium status is confirmed
