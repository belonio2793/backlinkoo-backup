# ✅ Payment System Updated for Supabase Configuration

## What Was Changed

### 1. Modal Updated
- **Header buy credits button** now uses `ModernCreditPurchaseModal` (matches the image you provided)
- Shows the exact same layout: preset packages, custom amount, features list
- Proper styling and user experience

### 2. Payment Flow Fixed
- **Removed local test Stripe keys** (these were temporary)
- **Updated payment service** to prioritize Supabase Edge Functions (where your real keys are)
- **Environment detection** now always tries Supabase first since that's where the Stripe keys are configured

### 3. Testing Tools Added
- **New test page**: Navigate to `/payment-test` to test the payment flow
- **Real environment testing**: Uses your actual Supabase configuration
- **Comprehensive logging**: Check browser console for detailed payment flow information

## How to Test

1. **Navigate to** `http://localhost:3001/payment-test`
2. **Run the Supabase Edge Functions test** - this uses your real Stripe keys
3. **Check the results** - should show successful checkout URL generation
4. **Test the actual modal** by clicking "Buy Credits" in the header

## Configuration Notes

✅ **Supabase Edge Functions**: Your Stripe keys are configured here  
✅ **Modal Interface**: Updated to match your design  
✅ **Payment Flow**: Directs users to real Stripe checkout  
✅ **Environment**: Uses your actual Supabase project  

## Next Steps

- Test the payment flow using the `/payment-test` page
- Try the actual "Buy Credits" button in the header
- Verify that users are redirected to Stripe checkout
- Check that the modal layout matches your requirements

The system is now properly configured to use your Supabase Edge Functions with the real Stripe keys you added to Supabase secrets.
