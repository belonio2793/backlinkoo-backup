# DNS Validation Status

## Current State

‚úÖ **App is functional** - Vite dev server running on port 8083
‚ùå **Netlify functions unavailable** - CLI crashes due to Playwright bundling errors  
üîÑ **DNS validation working with fallback** - Uses direct database updates when functions unavailable

## DNS Validation Implementation

The DNS validation system now has two modes:

### 1. Full DNS Validation (when Netlify functions work)
- Real DNS lookups using Node.js `dns.promises`
- Validates TXT records for verification tokens
- Checks A records against hosting IP
- Verifies CNAME records for www subdomain
- Updates domain status to 'active' when validated

### 2. Fallback Mode (current state)
- Direct database updates when Netlify functions unavailable
- Basic domain format validation
- Marks valid domains as 'active' pending real DNS check
- Allows domains to be used for blog publishing

## Functions with Playwright Issues

These functions need Playwright dependencies fixed:
- `comment-poster.js` - ‚úÖ Fixed with conditional import
- `blog-crawler.js` - ‚ùå Needs fixing
- `form-detector.js` - ‚ùå Needs fixing  
- `crawler-control.js` - ‚ùå Needs fixing

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Domains can be added and marked as validated using fallback mode
2. **Short-term**: Fix remaining Playwright imports in functions
3. **Production**: Deploy with proper DNS validation service

## Domain Publishing Ready

Domains marked as 'active' (even via fallback) can now be used for:
- Blog post publishing
- Custom domain hosting
- SEO content generation

## Testing DNS Validation

Use the "Test DNS Service" button on the Domains page to check validation status.
