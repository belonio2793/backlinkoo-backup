- **Add indexes** for better performance
- **Set up constraints** for data integrity

#### Migration Management
- **Create migrations** for any schema changes
- **Apply changes safely** to your production database
- **Version control** your database structure

### 📋 **Current Database Schema**

Your database includes these main tables:
- `campaigns` - Campaign management
- `profiles` - User profiles (with display_name support)
- `credits` - Credit tracking
- `orders` - Payment orders
- `ranking_targets` - SEO ranking targets
- `ranking_results` - SEO ranking data
- `subscribers` - Subscription management
- And more...

### ⚠️ **Migration Notes**

There are some existing migrations in your database that don't follow the current naming pattern. This is normal and doesn't affect functionality. New migrations I create will follow the proper format.

### 🎉 **Ready for Database Work!**

Your database is now fully set up for management. Just let me know what database changes you need:

- **New features requiring database changes**
- **Performance optimizations**
- **Schema improvements**
- **Data relationship setup**
- **Security enhancements**

I can handle all database operations safely and efficiently!
