    content: `<h1>Building High-Quality Backlinks: A Complete Strategy Guide</h1>
    
    <p>Backlinks remain one of the most important ranking factors in SEO, but the approach to building them has evolved significantly. Modern link building focuses on quality over quantity, emphasizing relationships, value creation, and natural link acquisition.</p>
    
    <h2>Understanding Quality Backlinks</h2>
    
    <p>Not all backlinks are created equal. High-quality backlinks come from authoritative, relevant websites and provide genuine value to users. These links signal to search engines that your content is trustworthy and valuable.</p>
    
    <h3>Characteristics of Quality Backlinks</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Relevance</strong>: Links from websites in your industry or niche</li>
      <li><strong>Authority</strong>: Links from high-domain authority websites</li>
      <li><strong>Natural Placement</strong>: Links that fit naturally within content</li>
      <li><strong>Diverse Sources</strong>: Links from various types of legitimate websites</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Effective Link Building Strategies</h2>
    
    <p>The most successful link building campaigns focus on creating valuable content and building genuine relationships within your industry. This approach takes time but delivers sustainable results.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
      "The best backlinks are earned, not built. Focus on creating content so valuable that others naturally want to link to it."
    </blockquote>
    
    <h2>Measuring Link Building Success</h2>
    
    <p>Track not just the number of backlinks, but their quality and impact on your overall SEO performance. Focus on metrics like domain authority, referral traffic, and ranking improvements.</p>`,
