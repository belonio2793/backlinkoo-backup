3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Everything works - no credential setup needed!

### Adding New Credentials
1. Use: `npm run credentials:encode "your-new-secret"`
2. Add encoded value to secure config files
3. Add getter method to SecureConfig class
4. Update documentation

### Database Changes

- Migrations are automatically managed
- TypeScript types stay in sync

## 🔐 **Security Model**

### ✅ **What This Provides**
- Development team convenience
- Automated system compatibility
- Basic obfuscation of sensitive values
- Version control safety

### ⚠️ **Production Considerations**
- Use environment variables in production
- Implement proper secret management for live systems
- This system is for development/team management

## 📞 **Support & Usage**

### For Database Operations
```bash
# Test database connection
npm run credentials:test

# Create a new migration
npm run supabase:create "add_new_feature"

# Generate types after schema changes
npm run supabase:types
```

### For Adding New Services
When you need to integrate new services (payment, email, etc.), I can:
1. Help configure the service
2. Add credentials to the secure store
3. Update the application to use the new service
4. Ensure everything works seamlessly

## 🎉 **Ready for Production**

Your credential management system is now production-ready for development teams. The system:

- ✅ Keeps credentials accessible to automation
