# Settings Error Fix Summary

## Issue
The application was throwing a `ReferenceError: Settings is not defined` error at line 1604 in DomainsPage.tsx.

## Root Cause
When I removed the Netlify Environment Status UI container, I also removed the `Settings` import from the lucide-react imports. However, there was still one reference to the `Settings` icon being used in the DNS Setup button that I missed.

## Error Details
```
ReferenceError: Settings is not defined
    at DomainsPage.tsx:1604:111
    at Array.map (<anonymous>)
    at DomainsPage component render
```

The error occurred in this line:
```jsx
<Button variant="outline" size="sm" className="text-xs">
  <Settings className="h-3 w-3 mr-1" />  // ❌ Settings not imported
  DNS Setup
</Button>
```

## Fix Applied
Replaced the `Settings` icon with the `Terminal` icon (which was already imported) since it's more appropriate for DNS setup functionality:

```jsx
<Button variant="outline" size="sm" className="text-xs">
  <Terminal className="h-3 w-3 mr-1" />  // ✅ Terminal icon
  DNS Setup
</Button>
```

## Why Terminal Icon?
- Already imported from lucide-react
- Semantically appropriate for DNS/technical setup
- Maintains the visual consistency
- Represents command-line/terminal operations which DNS setup relates to

## Result
- ✅ Application loads without errors
- ✅ DNS Setup button displays correctly with Terminal icon
- ✅ All functionality preserved
- ✅ React warnings resolved

## Files Modified
- `src/pages/DomainsPage.tsx` - Line 1604: Changed `Settings` to `Terminal` icon

The application is now running smoothly without any reference errors.
