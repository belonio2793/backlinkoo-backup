# Netlify Environment Status UI Removal Summary

## Overview
Removed the Netlify Environment Status container from the domains page as requested. This container was showing configuration UI to users and has been removed to handle Netlify setup internally.

## Removed Components

### 1. Netlify Environment Status Card
- **Location**: `/domains` page
- **Functionality**: Displayed current token status and configuration options
- **UI Elements Removed**:
  - Token status indicator (✅/❌/⚠️)
  - Token length validation display
  - Site ID verification status

### 2. Configure Netlify Token Section
- **Functionality**: User interface for entering Netlify personal access tokens
- **UI Elements Removed**:
  - Password input field for token entry
  - "Set Token" button
  - Link to Netlify token creation page
  - Token validation messaging

### 3. Related State Variables
- **Removed**: `netlifyKeyValue` state variable
- **Cleaned up**: References to token display formatting
- **Maintained**: `netlifyEnvStatus` for internal configuration tracking

## What Remains (Internal Functionality)

### Background Token Management
- Token detection from environment variables
- Internal validation and configuration
- Service initialization with proper tokens
- Error handling for missing tokens

### Service Integration
- NetlifyDomainService continues to work with configured tokens
- NetlifyCustomDomainService operates normally
- DNS management services function as expected

## User Experience Changes

### Before
- Users saw a prominent configuration UI
- Manual token entry was required through the interface
- Status indicators showed current configuration state
- Direct user interaction with Netlify setup

### After
- Clean, streamlined domains interface
- No visible Netlify configuration UI
- Internal token management and validation
- Users focus on domain management rather than setup

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Interface**: Removed configuration clutter from main domains page
2. **Simplified UX**: Users don't need to manage Netlify tokens manually
3. **Internal Configuration**: Setup handled behind the scenes
4. **Focus on Functionality**: Users can focus on domain management tasks
5. **Reduced Complexity**: Less UI state management and user inputs

## Configuration Now Handled Internally
- Environment variable detection: `VITE_NETLIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- Service initialization with proper error handling
- Background token validation
- Automatic service configuration based on available credentials

The domains page now provides a cleaner, more focused experience while maintaining all underlying Netlify integration functionality.
