## Technical Implementation

### Service Integration
```typescript
// Content filtering is integrated at multiple levels:
1. Blog Request Validation (before generation)
2. Generated Content Review (after AI generation)
3. Admin Monitoring (ongoing oversight)
```

### Filter Configuration
```typescript
interface ContentFilterConfig {
  enabled: boolean;
  blockExplicitContent: boolean;
  blockGambling: boolean;
  blockAdultContent: boolean;
  blockHateSpeech: boolean;
  customBlockedTerms: string[];
  whitelist: string[];
}
```

## How It Works

### 1. **Request Filtering**
When users submit blog generation requests:
- Target URL, keywords, and anchor text are analyzed
- Explicit terms are detected using pattern matching
- Blocked requests receive helpful suggestions for alternative content

### 2. **Content Generation Filtering**
Generated blog content is filtered before publishing:
- Title, content, and keywords are analyzed
- AI-generated content that violates policies is blocked
- Alternative content suggestions are provided

### 3. **Admin Monitoring**
All filtering events are logged for administrative review:
- Blocked content attempts are recorded
- Statistics help identify trends and threats
- Manual review tools for edge cases
